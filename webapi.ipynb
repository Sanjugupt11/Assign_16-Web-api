    "applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.\n",

    "Answer:-Advantages \n",
    "You have the code written for you. Just plug and play. Your development time is reduced significantly.\n",
    "If you are using standard APIs, then a lot of other people are using that as well. So your codebase is somewhat portable which at times is beneficial.\n",
    "Standard APIs usually have a lot of free community support in case you need troubleshooting. If you tend to write all of your own code then you are pretty much on your own as far as debugging is concerned.\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Well since you are using someone else's code, you have to understand the structure and assumptions of the developer.\n",
    "In case you need to tweak existing code to add some extra functionality you might need to wade through layers and layers of files just to identify the line where you need to make any changes. It can get pretty annoying at times."
